    <h3>I. The learning you have to do</h3>
    <div class="Challenges">
        While it can vary dependent on the high school experience - some people do find college easier than the senior years of high school - the density of the information and rapidity in which you must learn and then submit proof of your learning (read: assignments and exams) is more rapid. For some, this helps them stay focused and excel but for others it can be a real challenge.
    </div>
    <h3>II. Independence and self-management</h3>
    <div class="Challenges">
        Unlike most high schools, college is by default built on independent learning. So while a tutor may give you a slight reprimand if you didn't do your tutorial work - and all up won't push hard for you to learn. This process makes you a stronger and better individual (not just in college but life overall) but it can be hard for new students - even the most skilled and dedicated - to adjust at outset.
    </div>
    <h3>III. The size and scope of most colleges</h3>
    <div class="Challenges">
        Alongside navigating the new content and the need to learn independently many new college students have moved to a completely new area of their country - or even move to a new country to study - and that can be a significant adjustment.

In sum, it must be recalled by those new students that just like a sports team 'its not how you start but how you finish a game that matters'. So, looking to keep up with the pace, learn independently, and accept it takes time to adjust living somewhere new - means ultimately they'll soon find their feet as a new student.
