        Look:

        We all have different capacity and ability to learn and understand things.
        
        Some people are quick in learning…
        
        …And some others take the time to cope with the situation.
        
        It is absolutely fine when you try to learn things and it doesn’t come easy for you to understand and memorize them.

    <h3>Problem #3: Finding second-hand books, cheap furniture, electronics, and other college necessities.</h3>
    <div class="problem">
        College going students unnecessarily spend a lot of money during their college days. In each semester they have some new academic requirements like new books, stationery, cameras, electronics etc. They have to buy it NEW.

It’s really tough.

Students need some great deals that save their TONS of money. They need a space where they can sell or buy their used stuff.

Well, there are some portals for selling or buying used products. But the transportation is not easy in exchanging those second-hand items. Suppose you find an item on that portal, but the seller is at the other end of the city. It becomes so difficult to go to that person and carry used item.

But the GOOD NEWS is…

…There is an online exchange platform THAT IS ONLY FOR STUDENTS where they can sell or buy second-hand products Within their own college campus or nearby.
